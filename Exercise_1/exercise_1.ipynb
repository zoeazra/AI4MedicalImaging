    "During the class, a brief introduction was given to quantitative imaging. In this exercise, you will program your first neural network that will help estimate quantitative MRI parameters from quantitative data. In particular, we will be looking at the intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model for diffusion-weighted MRI:\n",

    "S(b)=S_0×( (1-f)×e^-b×D^ +f×e^-b×D*^ )                                                                    [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "With S the measured signal, S0 the baseline signal at S(b=0), f the perfusion fraction, D the diffusion coefficient and D* the pseudo diffusion coefficient. For more information on what the model means exactly and how it is used clinically, I would suggest reading \"Introduction to IVIM MRI | Radiology Key\" (https://radiologykey.com/introduction-to-ivim-mri/). But for the purpose of this exercise, it is just a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, f, D and D* (named Dp in the code) are obtained by fitting S(b) using least-squares fitting. But these approaches are known to be prone to noise in the data and often produce poor estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, you will write a neural network that predicts f from a given S(b). There are great tools available that take care of training models, such as PyTorch, Karas and Tensorflow. However, for the purpose of this exercise, you will make use of PyTorch. Moreover, we will use weights-and-biasses to keep track of how training is going.\n",

    "L.\tIdeally, you would train your network on real-world data. However, in this particular case, it is hard to get gold standard references. Luckily, we can use our understanding of physics, and of how stuff “should behave” to work our way around this. You will redesign your network loss, such that it can train on data without any gold standard references! Instead of placing the L2 loss on f_pred v.s. f_ref. Currently, the network is learning to minimize the difference between predicted fpred and the ground truth referene ftrue. In vivo, we may not have these references. To overcome this, we will now introduce a physics-informed loss. Use the IVIM equation [1] to propogate the predictions (D, f and Dp) into the signal space (S). Then, take e.g. the mean-square-error between the predicted signal and the input signal. Note that you will need to use torch functions (instead of numpy functions) to ensure you can backpropogate the loss through the equation into the network.\n",
